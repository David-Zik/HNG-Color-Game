## Project Overview

This repository contains my work on HNG-Internship Front-end coding task on build a color game. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build it.

## Task Description

The task is to build a responsive color game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The color game must include the required functionalities and elements. Each element must have a data-testid attribute for easy testing.

Functionality:

- Randomly select a color from a predefined set and display it as the target color.
- Implement the functionality for the player to click on the color buttons and check if they guessed correctly.
- Dynamically update the score and display messages based on the player's guesses.
- Ensure that the new game button correctly resets the game to its initial state.

Required Element:

- Color Display
- Color Option
- Game Instructions
- Game Status
- Score
- New Game Button

## Implementation

I implemented the game structures and functionalities using the following steps:

1. **HTML Structure**: I created the basic mark-up of the webpage with a semantic HTML structure including the required data-testid attributes.

2. **CSS Styling**: I applied CSS to style it to my desire and enhance the visual appeal of the page. The styling include: font, color/background-color, responsiveness etc.

3. **JavaScript for Real-Time Date**: I used almighty JavaScript to implement the game's logic and functionalities.

4. **GitHub Hosting**: With the help of Github pages, I was able to host my webpage live which made it accessible through the URL. [Color Game]().
